# Binary Trees

*This project contains C implementations of various functions and algorithms related to binary trees.*

## Overview

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

# This repository contains the following files:

- `binary_tree_print.c`: A file containing functions to print binary trees.
- `binary_tree_node.c`: A file containing a function to create a new binary tree node.
- `0-binary_tree_height.c`: A function to measure the height of a binary tree.
- `1-binary_tree_depth.c`: A function to measure the depth of a node in a binary tree.
- `2-binary_tree_size.c`: A function to measure the size of a binary tree.
- `3-binary_tree_leaves.c`: A function to count the number of leaves in a binary tree.
- `4-binary_tree_nodes.c`: A function to count the number of nodes with at least one child in a binary tree.
- `5-binary_tree_balance.c`: A function to measure the balance factor of a binary tree.
- `6-binary_tree_is_full.c`: A function to check if a binary tree is full.
- `7-binary_tree_is_perfect.c`: A function to check if a binary tree is perfect.
- `8-binary_tree_sibling.c`: A function to find the sibling of a node in a binary tree.
- `9-binary_tree_uncle.c`: A function to find the uncle of a node in a binary tree.

## Usage

# *To use these functions, include the appropriate header file (`binary_trees.h`) in your C code and compile the necessary source files along with your program.*
